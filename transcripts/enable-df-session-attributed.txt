Eva: So the aim is very much to create a sense that the group as a whole has really mastered a particular question, has made it its own, has gone through that difficult process of diverging perspectives, diverging opinions and moving towards some kind of agreement, some kind of sense that you have solved something through the conversation. So the flip side of that is the dynamic facilitation is probably not the means of choice when things are very straightforward, when you can actually see how a group can move from A to B to C, and that's clear from the outset. When there's already limited options, and you know that a group isn't free to kind of have those conversations that generate creative thinking. And the third point, when time is limited, that is part of the kind of thinking behind dynamic facilitation, that it takes more time because there is so much freedom for the group to drive the process. But that's, again, one of the things that we often debate because we have seen situations where dynamic facilitation can actually quite quickly deliver results. Okay, and with that in mind, let me introduce the problem statement for today.

Ben: I'm happy to tag in, Eva.

Eva: Okay, yeah.

Ben: So the problem statement that we're going to be looking at today, so it's a little bit of a change of pace. You've had the information about what dynamic facilitation is about, but in order to get a feeling of what it's about realistically and perhaps the little intricacies and differences between normal facilitation approaches, we're going to dive into our very own problem statement with which Ibra and I facilitate and you guys will be participants and then at the very end we'll have an opportunity to reflect on the process itself.

Ben: So the problem statement for our January session is how do we create common ways forward in an increasingly polarized society?

Ben: So just one final point on the process. I put a link into the chat and the nature of dynamic facilitation is important for you as participants to kind of take ownership of the boards. I say ownership in terms of like what you're reading and digesting. If it is possible, I would strongly recommend for you to view the boards like this, problem statement, solutions, concerns, and data.

Zachary: Yes, I saw the link in the chat, but then it disappeared before I could click on it.

Ben: Okay, I'll put it in there again. So I'm conscious that we're changing pace. There's a lot of new information and we're going straight into quite a deep topic. So I'm just going to pause for a moment to let us gather our thoughts before we descend into the conversation. So the problem statement we're going to be focusing on today: How do we create common ways forward in an increasingly polarized society? There's lots of opportunities where we could start there. Would anyone like to unmute themselves and open the discussion?

Zachary: Can you explain a little bit more what you're asking for? Are we talking about whether this is the right problem or are we talking about solutions?

Ben: So the really important thing here is to unpick that question — what does that bring up for you? It's often not yes, no, let's change the question. It's me raising that as a question, what's kind of coming up for you? And that could be, I disagree with the question, we think we should be focusing on something else. So whatever that brings up for you, that's what we'll use to explore. So, Artem, would you like to?

Artem: Yeah, sure. Thinking of the impact of social media and maybe large language models as well, because I think if they are guided by profit or some kind of market logic they can have very negative externalities which include polarization.

Ben: So you're thinking about the impact of social media and large language models, AI, and the fact that they're guided by profit, which can have negative connotations in society. So I'll invite you to go deeper on that. What comes up with you from that? What provokes you to bring that forward?

Artem: Well, I mean, everything that is in the news, I think all of us reading the news with some degree of shock and despair. A lot of people get information from social media and they don't appreciate that there are certain algorithms that are designed by other people to increase the engagement and so the more they are shocked and the more they share, the better for the platform. Unfortunately, those platforms are also natural monopolies, so it's very hard to build alternatives. Platforms like Blue Sky are trying to do something about it, but if you look at Blue Sky and Twitter, it's obvious that Blue Sky has very much lower number of users. Other people are trying to add community notes to Twitter, which is a different approach to solving this problem. But I'm going into solutions now.

Ben: So I'm sensing from you a frustration with regards to the impact that social media is having on an increasingly polarized society. And a lot of it is that on a deeper level, it's not just the setup of these platforms that they're based around engagement algorithms. And there are opportunities to perhaps explore other alternatives, which you mentioned, but ultimately that's difficult in the space that we're operating in.

Artem: Yeah, it's a massive coordination failure because it's really hard to do something with Twitter or X or Facebook or something else.

Ben: So you recognise it's really hard? So, I think really engaging with that is what perhaps possibilities may emerge if we are to think of solutions in this instance?

Artem: Well, of course, deliberative democracy could be one solution. Different kinds of social media, maybe not social networks but conversation networks as Audrey Tang proposed the concept. Basically, some kind of networks where people can deliberate on certain topics and then that produces some content that can also be discussed and it's not about selling attention to advertisers. Yeah, regulation, I guess, would be another thing.

Ben: So I just want to pause on that previous point that you raised and unpick that a little bit. So you talked about deliberative democracy could be the solution, but specifically designing technology in order to have these conversations. Am I correct in reframing that?

Artem: Yeah, having all different kinds of conversations in person, online, small scale, large scale. I think that's basically the best way to bridge opposing tribes.

Ben: So there's a linking back to that core question. Having conversations online, on a small scale, a large scale. This polarization that we're seeing, which is largely as a result of social media, is actually having these conversations on a larger scale and also a smaller scale gives us an opportunity to overcome some of those tribal differences. Is that a way of framing it?

Artem: Yeah, and hopefully just build the awareness of the problem itself because I think people need to do it consciously. We cannot force them to deliberate.

Ben: Okay. Is there anything else that you would like to put forward?

Artem: Probably not.

Ben: Thank you, Artem. So I'll invite others. Just a reminder that you might not be able to connect the dots at this moment in time, but that's the purpose of what we're working with here. I invite wherever your mind might be going to unmute and we can have an opportunity to unpick that as a group.

Caleb: So my mind went in a slightly different direction and I appreciate the points about social media. I think for me what stood out, and this is probably where my strategic planning background comes in, but just parsing the question a little bit, it seems almost like a bit of a red herring to look at the societal level. And also the phrase common ways. I'm not sure that that's the right scale. And that smaller scale community level would be a more effective place to focus on with that question. Of course, that could be aggregated to the societal level. And no group of people is going to have the same universal starting context or needs or priorities. And so I'm not so sure that there's one size fits all for ways forward for every locality.

Ben: So you're coming at it from the way the question's framed is talking about common ways and almost like a maxi-public. And you identify that this actually could be a red herring to look at on a societal level. We should think about how we can focus it on more of a community level and explore it that way. I'll invite you to go deeper onto that.

Caleb: I'm not sure that I have a whole lot more to add at this point. I think I've matched up my initial thoughts.

Ben: So when you talk about community level, how would you link the possibility of the community level to our initial question and the polarization within that community level?

Caleb: So there are certain things that polarize my community that may or may not be the same things that polarize your community. And so looking at the underlying things that are positive, it's gonna require nuance and deep-rootedness in that community to really understand it. And so that's kind of where I say the solution for one community isn't necessarily going to be the same just because that context is so different. That being said, we all are part of a greater community, whether state, regional, country, world. And so eventually there does need to be some aggregation. But I don't know if the solution is to start off looking at the whole of society level or to start off looking local and then you add local plus local plus local, at some point you get national, and then you add national plus national plus national and eventually you get world.

Ben: So you're talking about the fact that in your community there are different things that polarize, in other communities they might be different. And in order to really truly understand the differences and things that are polarizing people it requires a deep nuance, rather than making broad extrapolations. And you talked about whether it's about thinking about local times local plus local and an aggregating factor, or whether we start off in the broader context. I'll invite you to go deeper on that.

Caleb: I was already maxed out. How much deeper I can go, I'm not sure. Maybe I'll just say that there is an intentional theory of change that the common way forward may be more of a process than a solution in and of itself.

Ben: So do you mind just recounting that so I can capture that into notes?

Caleb: Yeah, so common way forward, instead of saying that there's a solution that's going to work for everybody and solve polarization across the society, perhaps there's actually a process that can be implemented, tailored to local contexts, and that process which is outcome and issue agnostic but enables bringing diverse groups of people together in positive, effective ways to come up with their own solutions is perhaps a stronger path forward.

Ben: So there's a solution that you're offering there. It's about focusing on a process that can be tailored to local context that is issue agnostic. And it's not about a one size fits all remedy, but it's about a process which then can be tailored.

Caleb: Yeah, it enables the people who are experiencing polarization to find their own solutions.

Ben: Thank you, Caleb. Sarah, did I see a mute button?

Sarah: Yeah, I'm struggling to unmute a little bit. I also don't think I have much deeper to offer. But thinking about Caleb's point there that I completely agree with, whether actually the question we're then asking ourselves is not how we create common ways forward, but how we enable people in unique communities that are experiencing polarization to come together so that they can find their own solutions. And actually we're taking it back that next step, recognising that the solutions will come from them, but maybe our role or the question is how do we actually enable that coming together in the first place?

Ben: Okay, so you agree with Caleb's sentiment about how we come up with common ways of providing a way forward. It's more about the process and how we enable that.

Sarah: Yeah, if we are comfortable that individual unique communities are able to answer our problem question, our problem statement themselves, then potentially, the question we need to be asking ourselves is how do we enable spaces where people who are experiencing polarisation feel that they can come together in order to start exploring what solutions might work for them.

Ben: So you talked about a potential shift in the question about how do we enable — I really want to capture this. So I'll invite you just to have an opportunity to perhaps try that reframing on how we can change that problem statement.

Sarah: So how can we enable unique polarized communities to come together to explore and identify their own solutions.

Ben: How can we enable a unique polarized community to come together, to identify and explore their own solutions. Okay. So I'm gonna have that as a problem statement, that shift in that question, and I'll invite you Sarah to perhaps using that different question framing, what are your immediate thoughts or feelings that come forward from you associated to this question?

Sarah: Yeah, well, I responded really positively to Caleb's comments. But one of the challenges is that we think that there's a solution and then we try and roll that solution out to all communities without recognising that every single one is unique. So if we want to empower communities to find their own solutions, I completely agree that would be the most effective way forward.
